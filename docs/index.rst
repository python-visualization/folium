Python data, leaflet.js maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the
mapping strengths of the `Leaflet.js <https://leafletjs.com>`_ library.
Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it in a Leaflet map via Folium.

Concepts
========

Folium makes it easy to visualize data that's been manipulated in Python on an interactive leaflet map.
It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations
as well as passing rich vector/raster/HTML visualizations as markers on the map.

The library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap,
Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom tilesets.
Folium supports both Image, Video, GeoJSON and TopoJSON overlays and has a
number of vector layers built-in.
