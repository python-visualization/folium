Python data, leaflet.js maps
****************************

``folium`` builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and
the mapping strengths of the ``leaflet.js`` library.
Manipulate your data in Python,
then visualize it in on a Leaflet map via ``folium``.

Concepts
========

``folium`` makes it easy to visualize data that's been manipulated in Python on an interactive leaflet map.
It enables both the binding of data to a map for ``choropleth`` visualizations
as well as passing rich vector/raster/HTML visualizations as markers on the map.

The library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap,
Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom tilesets with Mapbox or Cloudmade API keys.
``folium`` supports both Image, Video, GeoJSON and TopoJSON overlays.
